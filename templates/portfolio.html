            <h1>Pineapple View-Counter</h1>
            <p>
                Pineapple is an entire back-end pipeline for counting and maintaining views for all videos and shows at Hulu in real-time.
                It utilizes Redis, HBase/Cassandra (two different versions were implemented), and Cron-job. The performances of HBase and Cassandra
                were compared, and Cassandra was finally chosen as it showed stronger stability. HBase raised node failure issues,
                region server buffer overflow issues, and double counting issues during busy time. Cassandra showed strong stability while keeping
                counter accuracy in a reasonable range. This directly affects Hulu customers' experiences since lists of popular videos and shows
                that are displayed to customers are determined by sorting view counts.

            <p>
                Main Components: Client Application, Origin Server, Meta Server, CDN Nodes (local servers for caching),
                File Storage System (Central Data Center)
            </p>
            <p>
                Client Application: a Linux command-line application, which allows users to upload, download, and share files.
                Syncing between local file system and server file system is done every 5 seconds. Coordination between
                multiple users who share files is done by checking timestamps.
            </p>
            <p>
                Origin Server: a software load balancer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meta Server: a server that keeps track of a list of files that are uploaded or deleted, all the necessary
                meta data for every file, information about all the CDN Nodes in the system. Meta data includes file hashes and
                time stamps. It also contains a list of files that each CDN Node contains and ip addresses and ports of CDN Nodes
                as well as those of FSS. It optimizes the sync flow by checking file hashes and directs sync requests to
                right CDN Nodes by using its own selection algorithm. Selection Algorithm is as follows: 1. CDN Nodes that have file(s)
                in cache already 2. Choose the geographically closest CDN Node 3. If all the CDN Nodes that have the file
                in cache are farther than FSS from the Client App, choose the closest CDN Node, which does not have the file
                in cache. (this condition prevents the inefficiency which arises when a person first uploads a file in NY
                and later tries to access it in LA)
            </p>
            <p>
                CDN Nodes: local cache servers that are geographically distributed. Prefetching technique is used to increase
                cache hit ratio.
            </p>
            <p>
                File Storage System (FSS): a central data center containing all files.

            <p>
                A model that predicts the probability of every bidder being a bot given bid history and bidder information and
                achieved 88% accuracy. Ensemble methods are used to prevent overfitting/underfitting of the model. Extracted
                features of each bidder are: mean arrival interval, total number of bids, number of
                devices used, number of auctions used, number of different categories of participation, number of countries accessed
                from, and the fastest reaction time to the previous bid. IPython-Notebook and R are used.

            <p>
                Keyword Network is a new technique that can be used for topic modeling, suited for short texts such as tweets or comments.
                It is aimed to improve the performance of LDA models on short texts.
                It is a graph where nodes are keywords with directed weighted edges between them. Direction and weight of each edge
                is based on the probabilistic relationship between the two keywords (nodes). Community detection algorithm is applied
                on the graph to discover dense clustered groups of keywords, which are representative of possible topics.
                More details and experimental results are shown in this
