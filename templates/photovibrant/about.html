        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello, my name is Jin and I am currently pursuing MS in Computer Science at UCLA.
            I am focusing on distributed systems and machine learning during my MS, and those are my main interests.
            I love solving the challenges that I face when things need to work at big scale. Anything that needs to be
            optimized or fails because of scalability issues excites me.
            I also love exploring new technologies, especially the ones related to distributed systems or big data.
        </p>
        <p>
            From my internship experiences, I came to value code readability and maintainability more than anything else.
            Meaningful object-oriented class design, clean code, suitable choice of libraries, understandable comments,
            and even self-explanatory variable/method names are crucial to me when I code. Similarly, I believe simplicity
            always wins over complexity when designing back-end architectures.
