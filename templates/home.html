            Hello, my name is Jin and I am currently pursuing MS in Computer Science at UCLA after completing BS in Computer
            Science at UCLA. I am focusing on distributed systems and machine learning during my MS, and those are my main interests.
            I love solving the challenges that I face when things need to work at big scale. Anything that needs to be
            optimized or fails because of scalability issues excites me.
            I also love exploring new technologies, especially the ones related to distributed systems or big data.
        </p>

            From my internship experiences, I came to value code readability and maintainability more than anything else.
            Meaningful object-oriented class design, clean code, suitable choice of libraries, understandable comments,
            and even self-explanatory variable/method names are crucial to me when I code. Similarly, I believe simplicity
            always wins over complexity when designing system architectures.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for my hobbies, I love playing and watching soccer. I have been playing since middle school and am stil playing
            regularly. Particularly, I love the moments I and the rest of the team are connecting and making good plays as a whole.
            Wherever I go, one of the very first things I do is find a soccer team I can play on. I also enjoy playing poker and
            other various sports such as wake-boarding, skiing, ping-pong, and tennis. Of course, I love working on side projects and
            turning interesting ideas into products in my spare time.
